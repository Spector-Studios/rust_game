[![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/Spector-Studios/rust_game/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Spector-Studios/rust_game/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Based on the book [Hands-on Rust](https://hands-on-rust.com/2021/07/08/) by Herbert Wolverson, with following changes:
- Using [Macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) for rendering
